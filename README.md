So in my local area of Sacramento there is a booming tech community and there is a hackathon that happened here few months back. I know the founders and wanted to setup another smaller one. At the event I worked on building my own startup project I had been thinking about for a while, called "Social currency".

The idea behind it was to essentially use your social identity as a virtual wallet. It turned out exactly how I thought it would, although probably could have looked better if I had a designer with me. 

Anyways I thought id share all the source for the project.
